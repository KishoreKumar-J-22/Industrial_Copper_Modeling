# Industrial_Copper_Modeling
This project utilizes data science and machine learning to optimize industrial copper production. By analyzing production data, sensor readings, and environmental factors, we aim to predict key outcomes such as production yield, quality, and maintenance needs, ultimately improving efficiency and reducing costs in copper manufacturing.
